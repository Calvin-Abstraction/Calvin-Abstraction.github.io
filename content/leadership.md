## Changes in 2019-2020

We have tried to change how we do leaders in Abstraction. Of course, the core leadership to sustain the club will remain. However, we want a more modular non-core leadership for particular events. These one-off leaders will be able to use Abstraction's system to lead events of their interest. By making this change, we want to increase student activity in Abstraction and empower students by giving the opportunity to lead and plan events.

## Core Leadership

 - Ian Park, *President*
 - Samuel Zeleke, *Vice President*
 - Theorn Tjapkes, *System Administrator*
 - Nate Herder, *Treasurer*
 - Jason Pruim, *Secretary*
