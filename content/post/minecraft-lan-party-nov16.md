## Info:
This Friday, Abstraction will be holding a Minecraft LAN party. 
There will be Minecraft mini-games, snacks and lots of fun interacting with your fellow Minecraft enthusiasts. 
Come as you are, you need no Minecraft experience or a Minecraft account. Just come and have fun.

Where: SB 372, Maroon Lab

When: 6:00pm to 9:00pm


Unfortunately, due to the Java version available on the lab PCs, we'll be limited to Minecraft 1.16.

If you don't have a Minecraft account, click here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AWQXsJs16wkbGeXZbIt9EP2ewnGEPbkx/view?usp=sharing

Unzip that archive, and use a terminal (or command prompt on Windows) to change directories to the unzipped folder.

On Windows, run "gradlew.bat runClient"

On Linux, run "./gradlew runClient"
