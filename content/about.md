Abstraction is Calvin University's Computer Science Club. We focus on helping computer science students build community and skills through social events, programming workshops, and software projects. Not interested yet? We also will soon be hosting a Minecraft server, and plan on hosting online gaming events. (Still not interested? At physical events we'll have pizza and drinks, so make sure you're there!)
