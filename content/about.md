## Our Mission
*We exist to serve the community of Calvin students interested in computer science.*

Abstraction is a student organization centered around computing and technology.  Our goal is to build community among students interested in computing and to serve others by providing a space to have fun and to learn more about technology.
Some ways we serve the community are . . .
1.  organizing fun technology-centered seminars, workshops, and activities
2.  promoting job and internship opportunities
3.  hosting server space for students to be able to host interesting projects

Here are some handy [resources](/year-2020-21/resources)!
